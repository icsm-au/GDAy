<P>Each time you start GDAy, the <B>Default file name</B> for the log file is 
used to create a new file, or if the file exists, clear the file’s contents 
ready for logging. The purpose of this log file is to document particular items 
pertinent to user operation and individual coordinate transformations. For 
example, the input and output coordinate system parameters and the distortion 
grid file are logged by default each time you start GDAy. </P>
<P>Each time you press <B>Compute</B> on the main GDAy dialog, any errors that 
occurred (such as a point being outside the limits of the selected distortion 
grid file) are logged using the input coordinates and a short message. Whenever 
you perform a points file transformation, the input and output file names are 
logged. If there are any errors that occurred (such as a point being outside the 
limits of the selected distortion grid file, or when the coordinates can not be 
read from the file) they are logged using the input coordinates and a short 
message.</P>
<p>To personalise the log file created when using GDAy, you 
can add a header of information to the log file by adding text to the <b>Add header to log file</b> text box. Each time you start 
GDAy, or choose a new <b>Default file name</b>, the text 
displayed in this box is printed at the start of the file.</p>
