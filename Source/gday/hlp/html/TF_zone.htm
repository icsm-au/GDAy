<p>When computing UTM <A href="SRC=html\popup.txt TOPIC=IDH_PROJECTION" id=wPopup>projection coordinates</A>, you have the option to either specify a zone or accept the value computed by GDAy. </p>
<P>Unlike <A href="SRC=html\popup.txt TOPIC=IDH_GEOGRAPHIC" id=wPopup>geographic coordinates</A>, projection coordinates are not unique and must be accompanied by a zone value. 
For a UTM projection, the zones of developable surface are 6° wide and extend 
from 80° south of the equator up to 80° to the north. 
The origin of each zone is at the intersection of the equator and the 
central meridian of the developable surface. This origin for each zone is 
given a ‘false’ easting and northing (500 000E, 10 000 000N) to eliminate the rise of negative coordinates 
when working in the Southern Hemisphere.</P>
<P>For the 60 zones that are developed around the world, it is 
possible to have equal values of eastings and northings for completely 
different points. Therefore, it is necessary to specify a zone in 
which the projection coordinates lie. For the extent of mapping in the 
Australian region the zone numbers of 47 through to 58 are used, however only 
zones 49 to 56 are required to map the entire landmass.</P>
