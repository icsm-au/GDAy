<h1><a name="hid_format_geo_options"></a>Formatting options for geographic coordinates</h1>
<P>When you want to transform Formatted text files 
(*.dat, *.txt or *.prn) or Microsoft Comma separated values 
files (*.csv) having <A ID="wPopup" HREF="SRC=html\popup.txt TOPIC=IDH_GEOGRAPHIC">geographic coordinates</A>,
you can format your data to one of five types: <STRONG>Decimal 
Degrees</STRONG>, <STRONG>DMS HP Notation</STRONG>, <STRONG>Separated DMS 
Fields</STRONG>, <STRONG>DMIN HP Notation</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Separated DMIN 
Fields</STRONG>. </P>
<DL>
<DT><b><B>Decimal Degrees</B> </b>
<DD>If you work with decimal degrees values, the 
  <B>Latitude</B> and <B>Longitude</B> 
  fields (as described in Formatted text files and Comma separated files) should 
  each contain only one numeric value.
  <DD>
          
  <DD>
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>If you are working with *.dat, *.txt or *.prn files, the maximum number of 
  significant digits your values can have is 15 significant figures. Since the 
  maximum field width for both latitude and longitude is 16 characters, 
  excluding the decimal point leaves a maximum of 15 characters. For all 
  coordinates used throughout Australia, the number of significant figures for 
  the Latitude field will be reduced to 14 to cater for the negative (minus) 
  sign.
  <DD>

  <DD>
  <DD>If you are working with *.csv files, you do not need 
  to worry about a maximum character width. You only need to be concerned about 
  placing the whole of each value within the commas. 
  <DD>             
   &nbsp;
  

<DT><b>DMS HP Notation</b>
<DD>HP Notation stands for Hewlett Packard Notation and is 
  another well accepted format for degrees minutes and seconds. This form of 
  numeric input requires no additional spaces to delineate the values of 
  degrees, minutes and seconds. All values must be formatted so that the decimal 
  point appears directly after the degrees value, not after units of seconds.
  <DD>        
               
             
               
              
  <DD>
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>For example, a value of -24° 09’ 06.42588” would appear as -24.090642588
  <DD>
  <DD>
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>When working with HP Notation in *.dat, *.txt or *.prn files, the 
  <B>Latitude</B> and <B>Longitude</B> fields (as described in Formatted text 
  files and Comma separated files) should be formatted exactly as they would be 
  for decimal degrees. For example, the maximum number of significant digits 
  your values can have is 15 significant figures. Since the maximum field width 
  for both latitude and longitude is 16 characters, excluding the decimal point 
  leaves a maximum of 15 characters.&nbsp;
  <DD>
  <DD>
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>If you are working with *.csv files, you do not need to worry about a 
  maximum character width. You only need to be concerned about placing the whole 
  of each value within the commas.

<DT><b>Separated DMS Fields</b>
<DD>
If you work with Separated DMS fields values, the <b>Latitude</b> and <b>Longitude</b> fields 
  (as described in Formatted text files and Comma separated files) should be 
  formatted with spaces or commas (depending on the file type) between the 
  degrees, minutes and seconds values. The degrees and minutes values should 
  have a precision of zero (like an integer value), whilst the seconds value can 
  have a number of decimal places. 
  
<DD> 
              
               
             
                
        
  
<DD>
  
<DD>&nbsp;
  
<DD>For example, a value of -24° 09’ 06.42588” would appear 
  as -24 09 06.42588 or -24 9 6.42588 in a *.dat, *.txt or *.prn file. 
  Similarly, these values would appear as ..…,–24,09,06.42588,….. or 
  ..…,–24,9,6.42588,….. in a *.csv file. If you are working with *.dat, *.txt or 
  *.prn files, the maximum precision your seconds values can have is 7 decimal 
  places.

  placing a comma between the degrees, minutes and seconds values.

  <DD>
  

<DT><b> DMIN&nbsp;HP Notation</b>
<DD>The formatting requirements for DMIN HP Notation are 
  similar to DMS HP Notation, however the coordinates are formatted to degrees 
  and minutes only. All values must be formatted so that the decimal point 
  appears directly after the degrees value, not after units of minutes. 
  
<DD>
  
<DD>
  
<DD>&nbsp;
  
<DD>For example, a value of -24° 9.001071’ would appear 
  as -24.09001071.

<DT><b>Separated DMIN&nbsp;Fields</b>
<DD>The formatting requirements for Separated DMIN Fields 
  are similar to Separated DMS Fields, however the coordinates are formatted to 
  degrees and minutes only. If you work with Separated DMIN fields values, the 
  Latitude and Longitude fields should be formatted with spaces or commas 
  (depending on the file type) between the degrees and minutes values. The 
  degrees value should have a precision of zero (like an integer value), whilst 
  the minutes value can have a number of decimal places.

<DD>&nbsp;
  
<DD>For example, a value of -24° 9.001071” would appear as: 

  <DL>
    <UL>
      <UL>
<LI>
<code>-24 09.001071  </code>or <code>  - 24 9.001071</code>in a
