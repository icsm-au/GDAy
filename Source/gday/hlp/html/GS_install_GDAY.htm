Since the use of bi-linear interpolation is directly 
related to the region covered by the distortion grid, you need to select a 
distortion grid that covers the area you are workinfag in. When you run GDAy for the first time you will be prompted to select a distortion 
grid that covers the area you are working in and the transformation parameters 
to be used only when a point lies outside the limits of the grid.

<li>
For more help on selecting a distortion grid and transformation parameters, see Choosing a distortion grid file.
<li>
To obtain the latest version of the national GDA94 distortion grid, download it from the ICSM GitHub Site.
<li>
If you experience any difficulties in obtaining the grids, contact the ICSM.
<li>
If there is no distortion grid for your area, you may still perform 7-Parameter 
  transformations (medium accuracy ~ of the order 1 m) on the main GDAy dialog.
